**network-emulator** is a simple utility intended to test how network losses and
delays affect speech quality in VoIP-based applications.  With this tool
experimenter can set up loss rate, bandwidth, encoder options and select one of
the packet loss suppression algorithm.

Emulator can help quickly obtain these measures:

- compare encoding quality for different codecs and codecs modes;
- estimate the impact of the loss level and distribution on the speech
  quality;
- estimate the impact of the different PLC algorithms on the speech quality.

Quality estimation may be carried out subjectively but the better way is to use
automatic tests such as PESQ (reference implementation can be found at [ITU-T
official site][0]). Network emulator only helps to obtain reference and
degraded speech samples.

### Download and build instructions

Latest network emulator can be downloaded from github. You can either download it
with tarball or clone git reposltory.

Clone:

    $ git clone git://github.com/imankulov/network-emulator

Latest [tarball][1] or [zipped file][2] can be downloaded with given links.

In order to build network emulator from source it's ne—Åessary to download and
build [PJSIP library][3]. To use some proprietary
codecs as G.729 and/or G.723.1 one must follow [the instructions from PJSIP
project][4].

After PJSIP being downloaded and built you should set up enviromenent variable
`PJBASE` in order to specify location of this library. Either you can run
`make` command with this variable set up::

    make PJBASE=... all

PJSIP libraries are compiled in statically, so in order to deploy or use just
built application you don't need to modify your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or include
some parts of PJSIP in the distributed package. However Intel IPP codecs usage
requires correctly adjusted environment.
